# ISA - Issue Speech Assistant

ISA is a speech assistant for issue creation. With ISA product owners and developers can speak freely into the web application and structured issues are created automatically.

ISA was developed as part of a Bachelor's Thesis at the University of Stuttgart.

The application is currently deployed under https://issues.fabioschmidberger.de.

Here you can try it out yourself and experiment with the speech recognition. In the settings menu you can connect your personal Github repositories or a Gropius system.
The deployed version will be available at least until 31.03.2021.

## Overview

### App

React Web Application with the UI of the application.

### DeepSpeech

DeepSpeech Microservice for automatic speech recognition. Currently not in use, due to poor recognition accuracy of DeeeSpeech. Web Speech API is used instead.

### CoreNLP API

Microservice to annotate text, written in Java.
(in the folder ./nlp/cornenlpApi)

Note: The first request after startup to the corenlp container takes up to 2 min for a response. Future requests will be much faster.

## Development

### Start Application

Start App

```
cd app
yarn start
```

Start CoreNLP API

```
cd nlp
docker-compose up
```

This command runs a 3 stage docker build where the nlp model is build, the war file of the HttpServelet is build and the results are then assembled in a production container which is started.

## Deployment

The application can be easily deployed by running the following command:

```
./deploy.sh
```

The `.env` file needs to be configured.

### Host

For the deployment a ubuntu 20.04 VM with docker-compose is used.

Run the following on the server to allow more ssh connections, which is required for docker-compose:

`echo "MaxSessions 500" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
